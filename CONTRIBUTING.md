# How to contribute in Issues

Feel free to open an issue for any question or problem you may have. Committers or TC may redirect you to other repositories, ask for additional clarifications, and add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

Please be nice and respectful. Every participant is expected to follow our Code of Conduct.

# Contributions

This project follows the [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) workflow. Any change to resources must be through Pull Requests (PR). This applies to documentation, code, binaries, bindings, etc. Even TC or long therm committers are required to use pull requests. 

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed first by at least one Committeer.

For non-trivial contributions, PR should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review.
